<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Elliot, and I'm a second year computer science &amp; mathematics student at the University of Liverpool.  I have always been interested in computers, I made my first website when I was around 12 years old, and I remember thinking how cool it was that I could just make a website that other people could see from anywhere in the world.  I have made websites for fun ever since, although I don't make anything complicated because I always try to make my websites with absolutely no Javascript.
<br><br>
I've also always been quite good at maths, I think what I like best about maths is the problem solving.  That's probably why I also enjoy programming, as I like having a problem in front of me and being able to use my knowledge and my resources to solve it.  I have a pretty strong interest in cryptography and intend to make detailed looks into different algorithms and post them here for all to see on this site.
<br><br>
Outside of these two areas, I love watching movies and try to go to the cinema to see new films as often as I can.  As well as this, I have recently started learning Latin using Hans H. Ã˜rberg's Lingua Latina per se Illustrata series of textbooks.  In June of 2023 I managed to get a 3 month free trial of Duolingo, and I decided to use my 3 months to complete their latin course.  After I completed the course however, I found that it wasn't as in depth as I would have liked, and upon further research I found the aforementioned book series and decided to give them a try.  For you see, I enjoy reading classic books, and have often heard how reading a book in it's original language is incomparable to reading a translation, no matter how good it may be, and therefore I will continue to learn Latin until I can read some of the famous works of great Roman poets.
<h1>About cardenio</h1>
You may be wondering, why the name cardenio?  What does it mean?  And the rather simple answer to the question I assumed you to have asked yourself, is that while reading Don Quixote (an excellent book, that is very funny even 400 years later) I just really took a liking to the character of Cardenio, a man who went insane and ran away to live in the forest after seeing the love of his life agree to marry another man.  I'm not sure why I like him so much, to quote Marge Simpson, 'I just think they're neat'.
<br><br>
Now on this website, I intend to post about anything I find interesting, be it a movie I've seen, or an encryption algorithm I've researched.  I just want to share what I find interesting with the world, whether the world wants to listen or not is up to them.
<h1>Contact me</h1>
